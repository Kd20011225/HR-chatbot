The \nCompany will then work with the applicant or Employee to identify possible accommodations, if \nany, that will help to eliminate the limitation or barrier.  \n  \nIf the accommodation is reasonable, will not impose an undue hardship on the operation of the \nbusiness, and will not impose a direct threat to the health and/or safety of the individual or others, \nwe  will  generally  make  the  accommodation  or  we  may  propose  another  reasonable \naccommodation which may also be effective.

A reasonable accommodation is one that eliminates the conflict \nbetween an Employee\u2019s religious beliefs, observances, or practices and the Employee\u2019s job \nrequirements, without causing undue hardship to the Company. \n \nThe Company has developed an accommodation process to assist Employees, management, and \nHuman  Resources.  Through  this  process,  the  Company  establishes  a  system  of  open \ncommunication between Employees and the Company to discuss conflicts between religion and \nwork and to take action to provide reasonable accommodation for Employees\u2019 needs. The intent \nof this process is to ensure a consistent approach when addressing religious accommodation \nrequests. Any Employee who perceives a conflict between job requirements and religious belief, \nobservance, or practice should bring the conflict and request for accommodation to the attention \nof  Human  Resources  to  initiate  the  accommodation  process.  The  Company  requests  that \naccommodation requests be made in writing, and in the case of schedule adjustments, as far in \nadvance as possible. \n  \n \n \n \n \nTramontina USA, Inc. \u2013 Versi\u00f3n 4.0 \u2013   March 2025   Page  10  of  49\n \n \n                    \n   \n \n",
