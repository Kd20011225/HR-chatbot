Putting a little money away each paycheck can really add up \nso you can enjoy retirement. There are other advantages to contributing to your 401(k):\nTax Savings:  If you choose pre-tax contributions, you\u2019re saving money that doesn\u2019t have taxes taken out of it \nfrom the beginning, giving you more dollars to work with when investing and growing your savings plan. Plus, \nit helps now by lowering the amount of current income taxes you pay.\nConvenience:  You set your contributions and then they are automatically transferred from your paycheck. At \nleast that\u2019s one less thing you have to remember to do!\nPortability:  You can take this account and add in savings from a previous employer, or if you leave the \ncompany you can take your vested account balance dollars with you.\nInvestment Options:  You may contribute on a pre-tax basis as well as on after-tax basis if you choose a \nRoth 401(k). You can choose investment options that range from more conservative to aggressive, making it \neasy for you to develop a well-diversified investment portfolio. Target date funds are based on your \nanticipated retirement date and become more conservative as participants get closer to their retirement age.\nTramontina offers a 401(k) plan with a generous employer match and wide variety of investment options to \nhelp you prepare for retirement. Upon hire, employees will be automatically enrolled into the plan at 4% \nunless they elect to decline participation.\nYour Contributions\nYou can contribute up to 100% of your salary up to the IRS annual maximum, which is $23,500 in 2025. If \nyou are older than 50, you can contribute an additional $7,500 per year.\nThe Company Contributions\nTramontina offers a discretionary match of 50% of your contributions. Beginning in 2025 you will be able to\nreceive the company match on all of your contributions.\nVesting\n\u201cVested\u201d is a term used to determine how much of \nyour 401(k) funds you can take with you when you \nleave your company. While all the money you \npersonally contributed to your 401(k) is yours and \nwill go with you if you leave the company, the \ncontributions Tramontina makes to your 401(k) , and \nany earnings they generate are vested as follows:\nYears of Service Vesting Percentage\nLess Than One 0%\nOne Year 20%\nTwo Years 40%\nThree Years 60%\nFour Years 80%\nFive Years 100%16 Tramontina\n\nPage-16\nTable: [['Benefit', 'Vendor', 'Policy #', 'Phone', 'Website'], ['Medical/Rx', 'Cigna', '3343969', '800.244.6224', 'myCigna.com'], ['Dental', 'Humana', 'TBD', '866.427.7478', 'Humana.com/finda\\ndentist'], ['Vision', 'Humana', 'TBD', '877.398.2980', 'Humana.com/find-care'], ['Life, AD&D and Disability', 'Lincoln Financial', 'TBD', '800.487.1485', 'Lfg.com'], ['Accident, Critical Illness\\nand Hospital Indemnity', 'Lincoln Financial', 'TBD', '800.487.1485', 'Lfg.com'], ['Life Assistance Program', 'Lincoln Financial', 'N/A', '888.628.4824', 'guidanceresources.com'], ['401(k) Retirement', 'Fidelity Investments', 'N/A', '800.835.5097', 'www.401k.com']]",

For information on how \nto select a primary care provider, and for a list of the participating primary care providers, contact the Cigna at \n800.244.6224 or myCigna.com.\nFor children, you may designate a pediatrician as the primary care provider.\nYou do not need prior authorization from Cigna or from any other person (including a primary care provider) in \norder to obtain access to obstetrical or gynecological care from a health care professional in our network who \nspecializes in obstetrics or gynecology. The health care professional, however, may be required to comply \nwith certain procedures, including obtaining prior authorization for certain services, following a pre-approved \ntreatment plan, or procedures for making referrals. For a list of participating health care professionals who \nspecialize in obstetrics or gynecology, contact the Cigna at 800.244.6224 or myCigna.com.\nWomen\u2019s Health & Cancer Rights Act\nIf you have had or are going to have a mastectomy, you may be entitled to certain benefits under the Women\u2019s \nHealth and Cancer Rights Act of 1998 (\u201cWHCRA\u201d). For individuals receiving mastectomy-related benefits, \ncoverage will be provided in a manner determined in consultation with the attending physician and the patient, for:\n\u2022 All stages of reconstruction of the breast on which the mastectomy was performed;\n\u2022 Surgery and reconstruction of the other breast to produce a symmetrical appearance;\n\u2022 Prostheses; and\n\u2022 Treatment of physical complications of the mastectomy, including lymphedema.\nThese benefits will be provided subject to the same deductibles and coinsurance applicable to other medical \nand surgical benefits provided under the plan. Therefore, the following deductibles and coinsurance apply:\nPlan 1: Buy Up Plan (Individual: 20% coinsurance and $1,250 deductible; Family: 20% coinsurance and\n$2,500 deductible)\nPlan 2: Core Plan (Individual: 30% coinsurance and $2,500 deductible; Family: 30% coinsurance and\n$5,000 deductible)\nIf you would like more information on WHCRA benefits, please call your Plan Administrator at\n281.340.8400, ext. 1479 or maria.lopez@tramontina.com.\nNewborns\u2019 and Mothers\u2019 Health Protection Act\nGroup health plans and health insurance issuers generally may not, under Federal law, restrict benefits for \nany hospital length of stay in connection with childbirth for the mother or newborn child to less than 48 hours \nfollowing a vaginal delivery, or less than 96 hours following a cesarean section. However, Federal law \ngenerally does not prohibit the mother\u2019s or newborn\u2019s attending provider, after consulting with the mother, \nfrom discharging the mother or her newborn earlier than 48 hours (or 96 hours as applicable). In any case, \nplans and issuers may not, under Federal law, require that a provider obtain authorization from the plan or \ninsurance issuer for prescribing a length of stay not in excess of 48 hours (or 96 hours).Fixed Indemnity Policy Notice \n",

    "content": "Notice of Creditable Coverage\n\nImportant Notice from Tramontina\nAbout Your Prescription Drug Coverage and Medicare\nPlease read this notice carefully and keep it where you can find it. This notice has information about \nyour current prescription drug coverage with Tramontina and about your options under Medicare\u2019s \nprescription drug coverage. This information can help you decide whether or not you want to join a \nMedicare drug plan. If you are considering joining, you should compare your current coverage, \nincluding which drugs are covered at what cost, with the coverage and costs of the plans offering \nMedicare prescription drug coverage in your area. Information about where you can get help to make \ndecisions about your prescription drug coverage is at the end of this notice.\nThere are two important things you need to know about your current coverage and Medicare\u2019s \nprescription drug coverage:\n1. Medicare prescription drug coverage became available in 2006 to everyone with Medicare. You \ncan get this coverage if you join a Medicare Prescription Drug Plan or join a Medicare Advantage \nPlan (like an HMO or PPO) that offers prescription drug coverage. All Medicare drug plans provide \nat least a standard level of coverage set by Medicare. Some plans may also offer more coverage \nfor a higher monthly premium.\n2. Tramontina has determined that the prescription drug coverage offered by the medical plan is, on \naverage for all plan participants, expected to pay out as much as standard Medicare prescription \ndrug coverage pays and is therefore considered Creditable Coverage. Because your existing \ncoverage is Creditable Coverage, you can keep this coverage and not pay a higher premium (a \npenalty) if you later decide to join a Medicare drug plan.\nWhen Can You Join a Medicare Drug Plan?\nYou can join a Medicare drug plan when you first become eligible for Medicare and each year from October \n15 to December 7.\nHowever, if you lose your current creditable prescription drug coverage, through no fault of your own, you will \nalso be eligible for a two (2) month Special Enrollment Period (SEP) to join a Medicare drug plan.\nWhat Happens to Your Current Coverage if You Decide to Join a Medicare Drug Plan?\nIf you decide to join a Medicare drug plan, your current Tramontina coverage will not be affected.\nIf you do decide to join a Medicare drug plan and drop your current Tramontina coverage, be aware that you \nand your dependents may not be able to get this coverage back.\nWhen Will You Pay a Higher Premium (Penalty) to Join a Medicare Drug Plan?\nYou should also know that if you drop or lose your current coverage with Tramontina and don\u2019t join a Medicare \ndrug plan within 63 continuous days after your current coverage ends, you may pay a higher premium (a \npenalty) to join a Medicare drug plan later.\nIf you go 63 continuous days or longer without creditable prescription drug coverage, your monthly premium \nmay go up by at least 1% of the Medicare base beneficiary premium per month for every month that you did \nnot have that coverage. For example, if you go nineteen months without creditable coverage, your premium \nmay consistently be at least 19% higher than the Medicare base beneficiary premium. You may have to pay \nthis higher premium (a penalty) as long as you have Medicare prescription drug coverage. In addition, you \nmay have to wait until the following October to join.\n2025 Benefit Guide 25",
